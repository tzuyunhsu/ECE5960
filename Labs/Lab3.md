2. Discuss the pros and cons of three distance modes: short, medium, and long.  
  According to the datasheet, distance mode is a parameter to optimize the settings and tuning for the best ranging performance. The performance is evaluated by the potential application distance range and the ambient light conditions. The short one has less effect from the ambient while the long one got affected the most by it. However, the long one has the maximum distance range, which is more suitable for the final robot application if the robot needs to move around freely in a room.
