# Lab 4: Characterize Your Car

## Objective
After we learned how to implement sensors on their own, we want to get familiarized with the rest of the hardware, which is the stunt car. In this lab, I would start exploring the car by documenting the basic dimensions, the powering time period, the speed range, and the overall control experience.  

## Prelab
Since we want to combine the sensors setup from lab 3, we have to power the Artemis board with battery directly without the connection to computer. We have two 650 mAh batteries from the car kit and one 850 mAh battery from the lab kit. Since the motor is the major power consumption of the car and the control, we take one 650 mAh battery to power the Artemis board and the 850 mAh one to power the motor. First, we have to replace the black male connector of the battery with JST connector to fit the connection to power up the Artemis board. I cut the connection short and soldered the wires between the connector and the battery together. The colors of the wires are differed from each other, but I doubled-checked that the polarities are correct before connecting it to the board.

## Characterization
### Part A
1. Dimensions of the car: 
2. Weight of the car:
3. Charging time:
4. Battery life time:

### Part B
1. The range of speed:
2. The range of acceleration:
3. The braking distance:
4. What surfaces can it handle?
5. What stunts can it do?
6. How reliably does the robot turn around its own axis?
7. How well is the car operation with manual control?
