# Lab 5: Open Loop Control

## Objective
yet to finish...

## Prelab
We intend to parallel couple the two inputs and outputs on each motor driver, which means we use two channels to drive one single motor. This enables us to drive twice the average average current without overheating the chip. As for the circuit design, 

## Additional Tasks
1. According to the Arduino documentation,
